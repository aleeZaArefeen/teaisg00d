<div id="study"> <div id="def"><h2 style="text-decoration:underline">Define a p class style rule.
  Give the example html syntax of the p tag using the class style rule.</h2>
  <p>The class attribute specifies one or more class names for an element,
    which allows you to combine several css classes for one html element. An example would be < p style="color:red;"> Text goes here. < /p>.
  </p>
</div>
<div id="def"><h2 style="text-decoration:underline">Define a p id style rule. Give the example html syntax of the
   p tag using the id style rule.</h2>
   <p>
A p id style rule combines the function of a style tag with the id, which helps you pinpoint unique features that you want to add things to.
You can give some basic adjustments to the paragraph content with this or you can edit it all in the div tag (either on html or css).
An example would be < div class="whatever" > < p> Text here. < /p> < /div>.

</p>
 </div>
 <div id="def"><h2 style="text-decoration:underline">How would you center everything on an entire page?</h2>
   <p>In order to center everything on an entire page, one would have to use the center
     tags (< center >, < /center >). The center tag opening would go at the top of the code,
     underneath the title, and the closing tag will be at the bottom of the code before the
     closing html tag. All of the content in between will be centered, which in this case,
     is the entire page.</p>
   </div>
  <div id="def"><h2 style="text-decoration:underline">How would you indent a single word and put a square bullet in front of
      it?</h2><p>In order to indent a single word, you would use a style function called “text-indent”, and then put the word
      in an unordered list: < ul> < li> word < /li> < /ul> to put a bullet in front of it. However, that function will
      merely add the default circle bullet, so you would then have to insert a style inside the ul tag
      bracket like so: ul style =”list-style-type:square”>.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="def"><h2 style="text-decoration:underline"> What would you use to create a definition
    list to show that <br>the word “glunch” means look of disdain, anger, or<br>displeasure” and
    that the word “glumpy” means “sullen,<br> morose, or sulky”?</h2>
    <p>In order to create a definition list, I would create a two columned table
      for the terms <br>with two rows for the definitions.</p>
